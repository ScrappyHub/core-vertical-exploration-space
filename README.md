# CORE VERTICAL — Exploration & Space

This repository defines exploration and space-domain interpretation workflows.

It focuses on planetary physics, materials behavior, and EM coupling.

## Scope
- Planetary environment interpretation
- Material response analysis
- EM and thermal behavior visualization
- Research-grade exploration tooling

## Non-Scope
- No navigation control
- No propulsion systems
- No physics engines
- No platform authority

## Architecture Position
Consumes outputs from LITHOS, MAGNETAR, THERMOS, ATMOS, and RGSR.

## Governance
Governed strictly by CORE platform law.
