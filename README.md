# CORE VERTICAL — Space & Planetary Systems

This repository defines the Space & Planetary vertical for CORE.

It is a **full physics system** for modeling, interpreting, and validating space,
orbital, planetary, and deep-environment phenomena.

## Physics Stack (Authoritative)

This vertical composes the following engines:

- MAGNETAR — EM fields, radiation, induction
- THERMOS — thermal gradients, radiative heating, cryogenic behavior
- ATMOS — atmospheric density, ionization, drag (planetary)
- KINETIC — structural stress, vibration, launch loads
- LITHOS — planetary crust, regolith, subsurface materials
- SIGNAL — sensor fusion, telemetry coherence
- RGSR — multi-domain coupling & anomaly fusion

## Real-World Phenomena Modeled

- Rocket launches & ascent dynamics
- Orbital heating and EM exposure
- Re-entry thermal loads
- Planetary atmosphere coupling
- Surface/subsurface material response
- Spacecraft vibration and resonance
- Radiation-material interaction

## What This Vertical Is

- A **space-grade physics interpretation system**
- A **mission analysis & validation environment**
- A **planetary science & materials platform**

## What This Vertical Is Not

- Not mission control
- Not navigation software
- Not autonomous decision authority

## Registries & Lenses

This vertical maintains:
- Mission profiles registry
- Vehicle/material profiles
- Planetary environment presets
- Sensor pack definitions

## Governance

All engines and workflows inherit CORE governance.
No operational control authority exists in this repo.
